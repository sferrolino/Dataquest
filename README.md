This Repo is contain all the notes for the RDSA Dataworks Project: Dataquest - Intermediate Stream

<b>About DataWorks</b><br>
Data Works is a 3-month program for Ryerson students to gain introductory understanding of data science by building 3 introductory projects with the use of an online learning platform called Kaggle while also being a part of a slack community for assistance with their projects. 


<b>Our Program Mission</b> <br>
To provide participants with a community, resources, and skills they need to get started in the data science field.

<b>Program Structure</b> <br>
This 7-week program aims to give hands on experience with learning Python and Machine Learning with a showcase at the end.

Includes:<br>
- Commands and Descriptions<br>
